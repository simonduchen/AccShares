## About the project
This project is a native prototype of a mobile user interface for a smart lock application that uses the fingerprint scanner to verify physical accesses that are shared.

Since this is a prototype there is no backend actually storing data or connecting the application to any smart lock devices, it is only to show a native UI that contains the functionality and design that the project aimed for.

There are two test users that can be found in userdata.json, they are used to login to the application 

**Test user 1:** 

    username: simonduchen
    password: password
**Test user 2:** 

    username: linneabark
    password: password

If your device is compatible with a fingerprint scanner you can also login directly using that.
